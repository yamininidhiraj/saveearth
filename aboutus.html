		We do not have any other known planet beside earth in this universe where life is possible. It is the only known planet where the combination of most essential natural resources oxygen, water and gravity is found which makes the possibility of successful life here. We do not have time to think more about it and start saving earth seriously by following various effective measures in order to handover a healthy earth to our future generations. People should plant more trees to get sufficient oxygen and curb the effect of air pollution and global warming.
We should stop cutting down rain-forests to our life, atmosphere and homes of many different species. People should limit their use of electricity and use less fossil fuel to save the environment from global warming. They should promote the use of solar lights and wind energy to save destroying earth. Following the 3R rule (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) can be proved very effective in saving our precious earth.<br><br>

Few years back, I began to realize the developing trends of mankind were resulting in the poisoning of our earth. Later my thoughts centered around motivating other people to help stop this destruction. My vision soon became focused on Save the Earth, "a message to help create a higher level of environmental consciousness among people."Motivated by the awareness that the "Have a Nice Day" smile face of the 60's could bring a positive element into our daily lives, I knew that environmental artwork together with a meaningful message could become a positive influence on our earth’s future.In August 2019, I started this website to launch awareness among people about the planet's fate and take and provide suggestions of methods to prevent the planet from extinction.<br><br>
Today more than ever we must acknowledge the fact that a great many environmental violations of the past continue to haunt us in the present. Our support of research in the physical sciences will continue to find solutions to these numerous man-made problems of the past and present.
The goal to raise the environmental awareness of all people is key to making lasting changes to help our environment. Please join me and others like yourself and spread the word…”Save The Earth”.  Time is running out.<br>
Thank You for speading the word.<br><br>
Sincerely,<br><br>
Yamini Raj.<br>
