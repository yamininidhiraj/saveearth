    Thanks to Climate Change, Global Warming and Plastic Pollution, humankind is pushing the Earth to breaking point. We're also cutting down more trees than we should, not recycling as much trash as we should, and over-relying on fossil fuels for energy.

However, in this video, We take a look at the best, most innovative and most exciting inventions that really could save the planet. From alternative plastics to pollination drones, as well as paper upcyclers, recycled ink, eco capsules and carbon neutral aeroplanes, the future doesn't need to be a disaster!

<h4>25 solutions for Air Pollution</h4><br>
 Millions of lives could be saved and one billion people living in Asia and the Pacific could be breathing clean air by 2030 if 25 simple and cost-effective measures are implemented, according to a new UN report. Currently, about 4 billion people – 92 per cent of Asia and the Pacific’s population – are exposed to levels of air pollution that pose a significant risk to their health.
